# Secure factory defaults?

What's a sensible factory default configuration for SSH Stamp in 2025?

The firmware should be able to run out of the box, so it should have a sensible default configuration that allows it to operate without requiring any additional setup... but it also needs to comply with increasingly strict IoT cybersecurity standards... [rightfully criticised!](https://www.youtube.com/@mattbrwn).

**How should provisioning be done for this firmware?**

TBD (D for Discussed and/or Done).
