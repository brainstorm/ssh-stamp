# Testing

Testing on the host, on the target, both emulated (on CI) and via HIL:

1. How are pins managed across dev boards and ICs?
1. How is the actual HIL testing jig built? A few pin headers that accept all dev boards and ICs? Custom PCBs?
1. TBD: Show how CI/CD works for HIL testing. Perhaps custom (GitHub?) runners?
